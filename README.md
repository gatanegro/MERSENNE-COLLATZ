# The Mersenne-Collatz Correspondence: A Novel Connection Between Prime Numbers and Dynamical Systems

We present empirical evidence of a profound correspondence between Mersenne prime exponents and stopping times in the Collatz conjecture. Through systematic computational analysis, we demonstrate that numbers whose Collatz sequences require exactly  steps to reach 1—where  is a Mersenne exponent—form structured clusters with distinctive mathematical properties. These clusters exhibit hierarchical branching patterns, digital root distributions, and scaling behaviors that reveal previously unknown connections between number theory and discrete dynamical systems.
